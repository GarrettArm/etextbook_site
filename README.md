# etextbookSearch

There used to be a lot of scripts here.  They're still at branch:all_scripts for posterity.  But in the interest of people and processes over product, the product was heavily pruned.

This library will take a malformed csv from the campus bookstore and convert it into one useful for GOBI search.

Run it with ``python3 cleanup_bookstore_csv.py {{ filepath to malformed csv }}``
